The Idea
-------------
A radiologist's worklist is a table of information. We observed some radiologists using 30 or more columns, and requiring all that information. This required them to scroll horizontally, which sucks. Or radiologists have to constantly customize their table.

We propose a taller tabular layout that presents the relevant information on screen without requiring scrolling.

Integrated Buttons
-------------
Buttons are integrated directly onto a procedure row.

Also included are indications of whether images are completed, and whether anyone is reporting. By default, these fields are dark so as to not overwhelm the radiologist. Only when necessary to alert them do they light up.

Visually indicated information
-------------
By relying on a more visual metaphor, the system is able to more effectively communicate information about stats and bookmarks?

A stat is indicated by a tasteful banner around the case.

A bookmark is indicated by a page curl.
