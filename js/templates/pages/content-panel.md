Content Panel
=============

Opportunity
-------------
Radiologists must navigate multiple windows in their existing software. A significant portion of their workflow consists of positioning and resizing windows.

We propose a customized layout panel for the display of scanned documents, priors, and other materials related to a particular case. Click on a prior case for a demonstration.

Multiple Priors
-------------
A single click will populate the panel with the document. Holding and dragging a prior allows a radiologist to position the second prior side by side, allowing a radiologist to easily compare the two.

Click and drag a prior from the timeline to the Content Panel for a demonstration. The UI will hint at where the additional content can be placed.

Maximize
-------------
The radiologist may need to view a larger version of the content that is in the dynamic workspace.

The magnify button fills the entire workspace with the specific document.

Machine Learning
-------------
Over time, the system can learn a particular radiologist's preferences for layouts. For instance, a radiologist might have a particular process for reading a CT vs. an MRI.

Mimicing the Smart Reading protocol in PACS, the Content Panel will determine the most relevant information to display for a particular modality based on a radiologist's past history. The panel will automatically display that information and will improve over time as it learns a radiologist's preferences.


“Thats a good idea, especially if I can switch between different priors when I work, and if I can see the referral information” Asmussen
