Caregivers
=============

Opportunity
-------------
We observed radiologists struggle to find contact information of healthcare professionals involved with a particular patient. Information is currently scattered across various databases and locations in the system.

We propose a feature to list contact information of related caregivers. Click on the Related Caregivers button for an example.

Easy Access
-------------
Radiologists, technologists, and referring physicians associated with a particular patient are listed in a modal dialog.

A user can view the last time a particular caregiver saw a patient, and can easily locate contact information for that caregiver.

If a particular phone or pager number is no longer accurate, the record can be flagged for later review and update.
