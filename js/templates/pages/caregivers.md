Caregivers
=============

Opportunity
-------------
Information about healthcare professionals associated with a particular patient is currently scattered across various databases and locations. We observed radiologists struggle to locate contact information of their colleagues.

We propose a feature that lists all related caregivers and their contact information. This list is accessible in current and prior exams. The Related Caregivers feature can shave time off of the radiologistâ€™s workflow by providing immediate access to the person that she wants to contact.

How it Works
-------------
Radiologists, technologists, and referring physicians associated with a particular patient are listed in an unobtrusive modal dialog.

A user can easily the last time a particular caregiver saw a patient, and can easily locate contact information for that caregiver.

If a particular phone or pager number is no longer accurate, the record can be flagged for later review and update.
