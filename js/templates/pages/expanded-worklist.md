Expanded Worklist
=============

Opportunity
-------------
A radiologist's worklist is a table of information, often containing more columns than can fit on the screen at a time. This forces the radiologist to scroll horizontally, which can slow down the radiologist.

We propose a taller layout in order to present more relevant information on the screen without requiring horizontal scrolling. This layout can effectively integrate case indications along with active buttons, such as the Queue button. Try queueing a case now.

Focus on Patients
-------------
Building on the traditional data grid, this redesign applies visual variances to distinguish between attributes and group related attributes together.

Stats are indicated by a banner. The exam date is formatted to show how long it has been in the system, and can be hovered over for additional information. Referring physician and location are available for quick reference, along with indications concerning whether images are ready, and whether another radiologist is currently reading the exam.

The worklist can also be switched to a card view layout, known as "Case Cards".

Case Cards
-------------
This modular layout mimics the physical world and is intuitive at a glance. Placing the case within a card has the benefit of being patient-centric, and displaying fewer number of cases within the worklist has the potential to reduce cherrypicking.

Radiologists have the option of selecting either worklist layout because each has its own benefits.
