Expanded Worklist
=============

Opportunity
-------------
A radiologist's worklist is a table of information. Some tables we observed contained over 30 columns of data. This required horizontal scrolling to view relevant columns which slows down the radiologist.

We propose a taller layout in order to present more relevant information on the screen without requiring horizontal scrolling.

Redesign
-------------
We redesigned the worklist to put focus on the patient cases.

Building on the traditional data grid, the redesign applies visual variances to distinguish between attributes and group related attributes together.

The worklist can also be switched to a card view layout, known as "Case Cards".

Case Cards
-------------
This modular layout mimics the physical world and is intuitive at a glance. Placing the case within a card has the benefit of being patient-centric, and displaying fewer number of cases within the worklist has the potential to reduce cherrypicking.

Radiologists have the option of selecting either worklist layout because each has its own benefits.
