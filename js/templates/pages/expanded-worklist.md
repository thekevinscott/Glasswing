Expanded Worklist
=============

Opportunity
-------------
The worklist is a table of information that ofte contains more columns than can fit on the screen at one time, forcing the radiologist to scroll horizontally.

We propose a taller layout in order to present more information at a glance. This layout can effectively integrate case indications along with active buttons. Try queueing a case now.

Focus on Patients
-------------
This redesign applies visual variances to distinguish between attributes and group related attributes together.

Stat cases are indicated by a banner icon, and the exam date is formatted to show duration from entry.

“Having a countdown/up could be intimidating, but delivers a sense of urgency.” -- Tommy Olesen

The user can see referring physician and location, along with whether images are ready, and whether another radiologist is currently reading the exam.

The worklist can also be switched to a card view layout, known as "Case Cards". Click on the Case Card button now.

Case Cards
-------------
This modular layout mimics the physical world and is intuitive at a glance. Placing the case within a card has the benefit of being patient-centric, and displaying fewer number of cases within the worklist has the potential to reduce cherrypicking.

Radiologists have the option of selecting either worklist layout because each has its own benefits.
