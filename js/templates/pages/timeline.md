Timeline
=============

Opportunity
-------------
We observed radiologists frequently use the timeline feature in their RIS software, which visualizes a patient’s medical history and links to all of the prior reports. We leveraged the work of PIVotal, a previous team from Carnegie Mellon University researching radiology software.

A user can easily switch between relevant and all priors. Click on the All Priors button for an example.

Implementation
-------------
The timeline PIVotal designed contains a condensed timeline next to a tabular list of priors. The timeline helps provide the context of the patient’s medical history, while the scrollable list view displays consistent information for each priors.
