Timeline
=============

Opportunity
-------------
We observed radiologists frequently use the timeline feature in their RIS software, which visualizes a patient’s medical history and links to all of the prior reports.

We saw an opportunity to enhance existing timeline design by leveraging the work of Pivotal, a previous MHCI team from Carnegie Mellon University that also collaborated with GE Healthcare.

Implementation
-------------
The timeline that Pivotal designed contains a condensed timeline next to a tabular list of priors. The timeline helps provide the context of the patient’s medical history, while the scrollable list view displays consistent information for each priors.

Our timeline feature builds on this design by adding controls to filter the list between all and relevant priors.
