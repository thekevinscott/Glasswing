Tabs
=============

Opportunity
-------------
We observed radiologists struggle to switch cases effectively. Radiologists need to switch cases in order to handle interruptions and collaborate with colleagues.

We propose a tab-based interface to handle case switching. Click on the highlighted procedure to see a demonstration.

Handling Interruptions
-------------
Radiologists collaborate constantly. Current software does not adequately support a radiologist's need to easily respond to interruptions and switch cases.

In our proposed interface, a radiologist can easily return to the worklist to view a colleague's case. Click on the worklist tab, and then click on another case.

Design
-------------
In our design, the active tab is conveyed via the use of color in a  way that blends into the design. Modality and body part are prominently featured, with patient name and ID present but de-emphasized.

This design was based on direct feedback from radiologists, who expressed an interest in seeing modality and body part above all else.

Alerts
-------------
If a radiologist has multiple tabs open and new updates come in for a particular case (for instance, if there are new images available) the system will alert the radiologist via the use of a subtle notification icon.

The radiologist can choose to immediately view the notification by hovering over the icon, or can ignore it and leave it for later.
