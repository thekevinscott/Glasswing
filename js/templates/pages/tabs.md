Tabs
=============

The Idea
-------------
We observed radiologists struggle to switch cases effectively. Radiologists need to switch cases in order to handle interruptions and collaborate with colleagues.

We propose a tab-based interface to handle case switching. Click on the highlighted procedure to see a demonstration.

Handling Interruptions
-------------
Radiologists collaborate constantly. Current software does not adequately support a radiologist's need to easily respond to interruptions and switch cases. If a colleague requests a radiologist to open a case, the radiologist must currently close what they are working on, which results in lost time returning to their place.

In our proposed interface, a radiologist can easily return to the worklist and view a colleague's case. Once done, the radiologist can quickly and efficiently return to the case they were working on.
