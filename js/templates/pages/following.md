Opportunity
-------------
Radiologists may want to know when there are updates to a particular case. Current software forces the radiologist to manually check for updates.

We propose a notification system to alert a radiologist when an update to a case has occured. Click on the Follow button for an example.

Alerts
-------------
The system informs the radiologist they are now following the case. The radiologist can close the tab and continue reading other cases.

When there is a relevant update to a followed case, a notification appears in the notification center. Hovering over the icon will reveal a list of updates, and a radiologist can click the relevant update and be taken directly to that case.
