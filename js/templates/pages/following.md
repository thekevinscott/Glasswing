Opportunity
-------------
Radiologists may want to know when there are updates to a particular case. Current software forces the radiologist to manually check to look for updates.

We propose a notification system to alert a radiologist when an update to a case has occured. Click on the Follow button for an example.

Alerts
-------------
The system informs the radiologist they are now following the case and can freely close the case. They can also unfollow by clicking the button again.

When a case being followed is updated, a notification appears in the notification center. Hovering over will reveal a list of updates, and a radiologist can click the relevant update and be taken directly to that case.
